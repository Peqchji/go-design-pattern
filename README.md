# 🛠️ Go Design Patterns: AI-Driven Learning

A collection of **Go (Golang)** design pattern implementations and **SOLID** principle examples. This repository serves as a dedicated practice ground for building scalable, maintainable, and high-performance backend systems.

## 🤖 AI-Driven Learning Approach
This repository is part of a deliberate practicing strategy where **AI is used as a mentor and collaborator**. Every pattern implemented here has been:
1.  **Iteratively Refined:** Using AI to critique code for "Go-idiomatic" correctness.
2.  **Scenario-Tested:** Leveraging AI to generate edge-case requirements and real-world system design scenarios.
3.  **Benchmarked:** Analyzed for performance and memory efficiency through AI-assisted code reviews.

## 🏗️ Core Principles
The implementations here prioritize:
* **SOLID Principles:** Decoupling logic for maximum testability.
* **Concurrency Patterns:** Utilizing Go’s unique primitives (channels/goroutines) within classic patterns.
* **Maintainability:** Writing code that is as easy to read as it is to execute.

## 📂 Patterns Included
* **Creational:** Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype.
* **Structural:** Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade.
* **Behavioral:** Strategy, Observer, Command, State, Template Method.
